# Open Source LLM Chatbots on CPU in Google Colab

Hello everyone, in this repository we are going to run some of the best LLM Chatbots that can run on a CPU by using Google Colab.

The list of LLM that we are interested to run are:

- CodeLlama-7B,
- Llama-2-13B-chat,
- Falcon-7B-Instruct
- Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
- Zephyr-7B-beta,
- Vicuna-7B-v1.5



In this repository we created a simple application that runs different Language Large Models that are free and open source.
